POP

1.
  Pop is a configurable installation framework primarily designed on linux, but should
  have no problem running on other systems.

  Pop is designed to be user friendly and configurable on every system.

2.
  In hindsight, pop seems very complicated/difficult to use, but that is
  in fact not the case, Pop uses a ~/.pop configuration file in the JSON
  file format for configuring the entire package manager.

  Installation is guided by a "bindir" variable, which gives Pop information on
  where to put the installed binaries.
